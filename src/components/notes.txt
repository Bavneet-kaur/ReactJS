>> Fragments are only needed if you return multiple sibling elements

>>In React, a component is a reusable piece of UI. 
Think of it like a Lego brick—you can build complex UIs by stacking small, manageable pieces. ~profileCard 

>> Props (short for properties) let you pass data from a parent component to a child component.
Think of it like this:Your component 1(productCard) is a template. Props let you fill in the blanks dynamically. ~productCard

>>state is a way to store and manage data within a component. Unlike props (which are passed from parent to child), 
state is managed within a component and can change over time, causing the component to re-render when the state changes. 
State updates are asynchronous, meaning React doesn’t immediately apply the changes but schedules them for later. 
This is why you should not rely on the immediate value of the state after calling setState. ~counter
