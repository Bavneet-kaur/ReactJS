>>Redux is a state management library for JavaScript apps (commonly used with React).
It provides a centralized store for all your application state, making it predictable and easier to debug â€” 
especially when many components need to share or modify the same state.

In simple words: ðŸ‘‰ Instead of managing state individually in components, you store it in a global store.
ðŸ‘‰ Components can then read from the store and dispatch actions to modify it.

>>A single object that holds the entire application state.
Created using createStore() (in older Redux) or configureStore() (in Redux Toolkit).
